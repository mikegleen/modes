introduction
============

This library provides for manipulation of the XML files exported from
and imported into the *Modes* Museum database system. The source files
contain many special-purpose programs that apply only to the Heath
Robinson Museum database. However, there are several general-purpose
programs that will be documented here.

.. warning::
   Many of the programs will encounter non-fatal errors and complete without
   aborting although the output may not be as you wish. It is important to
   examine the printed output of a program run to determine if it completed
   successfully.
